1
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:06,640
Okay, Wi-Fi plus 3G, 64 gig.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,760
This one, this one.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,640
Oh, sweetie, $900?

4
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:14,622
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,642
Eric, we can't afford that one.

6
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:20,324
Well, you don't expect me to get the Wi-Fi only 16 gig version, do you?

7
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:22,944
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon.

8
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:24,025
They're a little cheaper.

9
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:27,126
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid.

10
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:28,786
Here, look at this one.

11
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,306
Toshiba Handibook.

12
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:31,827
Toshiba Handibook?

13
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:35,811
This says it does everything the iPad does at half the price.

14
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:38,194
Mom, do not screw me over again!

15
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:41,938
If I take that thing to school, everyone's gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,561
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat.

17
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:47,885
You can either have the Toshiba Handibook, or you can have nothing at all.

18
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:50,493
Oh, I've got a better idea.

19
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:53,075
Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?

20
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:55,877
Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom.

21
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:56,818
Eric?

22
00:00:57,038 --> 00:01:01,081
You might as well go buy some cigarettes, too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked.

23
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:02,242
You wanna fuck me, Mom?

24
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:02,863
Just say so.

25
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:03,884
Go ahead.

26
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:04,184
Here.

27
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:05,405
Huh?

28
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:06,226
Go ahead, Mom.

29
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:06,646
Fuck me.

30
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:08,207
Fuck me right here in the best bath.

31
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,688
You wanna fuck your son so bad?

32
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:10,209
Go on, Mom.

33
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:10,589
Fuck me.

34
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:11,290
Fuck me!

35
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,180
Stop crying, Eric.

36
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,623
I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything.

37
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:23,005
But I told you I was sorry.

38
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:27,169
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people.

39
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,271
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.

40
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:35,638
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say, help, help, my mom is trying to fuck me?

41
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:39,438
Oh, wait, I get it now.

42
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:43,461
The F word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people.

43
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,742
I'm sorry, Mama.

44
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:48,925
If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything.

45
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:57,071
Well, no, that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad.

46
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,755
Mama, please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba handybook?

47
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:02,696
No!

48
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:06,495
Well, then could we at least pull up here and get some dinner?

49
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:08,979
Because I like to be wined and dined after...
