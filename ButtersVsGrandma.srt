1
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:04,569
Grandma?

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,310
I did it, Grandma.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,572
I finally stood up for myself.

4
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:11,514
I got real mean and I beat the snot out of Dr. Oz.

5
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:14,215
I can't lie, it felt kind of good.

6
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:15,296
At first.

7
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:18,938
But since then, all I have is this kind of dark, empty feeling.

8
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:23,281
And then I realized, that's how you must feel.

9
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:24,361
All the time.

10
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:26,663
Poor old Grandma.

11
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,505
You know, I've been getting lots of advice how to deal with you.

12
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,506
Stand up to you, tell on you.

13
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:34,668
But I kinda realize there's just people like you out there.

14
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:36,409
All over the place.

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,292
When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever.

16
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:41,613
But they're not.

17
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:43,194
Life changes.

18
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,116
You won't always be around.

19
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,497
Someday you're gonna die.

20
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,360
Someday pretty soon.

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:59,086
And when you're laying in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pain under your butt to pee in, I'll come visit you.

22
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll come just to show you that I'm still alive and I'm still happy.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,721
And you'll die.

24
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,943
Being nothing but you.

25
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:09,866
Night, Grandma!
